## Changelog

The brief, illustrious history of `sopel-rainbow`, a silly little plugin
spawned from [a tongue-in-cheek
upstream issue](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/issues/1962).


### sopel-rainbow 0.1.0

Initial release, featuring:

* `.rainbow` command
* Configurable color order
* Optional randomized start point
* Control-code stripping on Sopel 7.1+
* Compatible with Sopel 7.0 through (planned) 8.x releases
